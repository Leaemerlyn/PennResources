# Welcome to Penn Resources
## Overview
### Project summary
This tool is meant for MCIT Online students who are looking for supplemental resources for course material. In the site, users can select a course and a module within that course, and it will display all of the available resources that other students have posted. Users can also see their own contributions on a dedicated page.
We created this site for the MOSA Summer 2023 Hackathon. It was made using React and Node.js for the frontend, and Firebase for the backend.

## Additional information

### Tools used

Which frameworks, libraries, or other tools did you use to create your project?

* [React](https://react.dev/) - A Javascript-based framework for website development

### Acknowledgments

Use anyone else's code? Inspired by a particular project? List / link here.

* Inspiration: The layout of the website was inspired by [MCITCentral](https://mcitcentral.com/).
* Use of RSuite: We followed the instructions and code examples from the official [RSuite](https://rsuitejs.com/) website and online guides to use their provided components ([React Form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-suite-form-component/) and [React Button](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-suite-button-size/)).
* Google Authentication: Like MCITCentral, we use Google Sign In as the login authenticator. We followed the directions and code examples from the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) documentation to facilitate the login and logout process. We also followed the instructions and code from two webpages ([page 1](https://textav.gitbook.io/firebase-react-notes/auth/google-sign-in/google-sign-in-custom-domain) and [page 2](https://zachrussell.net/blog/firebase-auth-restrict-login-by-domain/)) to restrict the email domain to seas.upenn.edu.
* Use of Firestore: We followed the directions and code examples from the Firebase documentation about [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), which stores the backend data for this project.
* React and JavaScript Fundamentals: Since most of the group members were new to React and JavaScript, we used multiple resources to learn the fundamentals. We watched tutorial videos ([tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hR-uWjBAgw) and [tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Wltnv-doo&list=PLpPqplz6dKxW5ZfERUPoYTtNUNvrEebAR)) and read online guides ([JavaScript var, const, let](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/), [JavaScript ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator), [JavaScript spread operator](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_spread.asp), [JavaScript regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions), [JavaScript map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), [JavaScript array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [JavaScript function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_invocation.asp), [JavaScript function parameters](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp#:~:text=Arguments%20are%20Passed%20by%20Value,change%20the%20parameter's%20original%20value.), [React key identifier](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key), [React useEffect](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_useeffect.asp), [React onChangeCapture Event](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-onchangecapture-event-in-reactjs/), [React CRUD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-do-crud-operations-in-reactjs/)).
